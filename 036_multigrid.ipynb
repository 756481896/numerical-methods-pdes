    "As a concrete example consider again the similar example from before where $m = 2^8 - 1 = 255$ and using $n = 3$.  If we allow recursive coarsening down to 3 grid points (7 levels of grids).  On each level we apply 3 iterations of Jacobi.  If we apply these Jacobi iterations on the way \"down\" the V-cycle and on the way up (not necessary in theory) we would do 6 iterations of Jacobi per level.  This leads to a total of 42 Jacobi iterations on variously coarsened grids.  The total number of updated values then would be\n",

To do this we do a few iterations on the coarsest level or solve the problem directly since the cost should be low at the coarsest level.  We then interpolate to the next finer level and solve the problem there.  We can then cycle back down to the coarsest level or continue upwards until we get to the finest level where we wanted to be in the first place.  We then switch back to solving for the error rather than the original problem and proceed as before.  This approach is usually labeled as *full multigrid* (FMG)."

Luckily there are a number of areas where research has been done to determine optimal methods (in some sense) for a given problem and discretization.  There are also variations that include more complex ways to \"coarsen\" the error and residual.  In general these are called *algebraic multigrid* methods (AMG).  These are especially useful when it is not obvious how to coarsen the residual problem."
