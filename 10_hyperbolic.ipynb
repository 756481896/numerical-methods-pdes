Which boundary is which is determined by the direction of the flow, i.e. the sign of $a$.  Numerically this may cause problems depending on the discretization we use (if we need a point from the out-flow boundary for instance).  Instead in practice we will get around this by numerically setting a boundary that does not conflict with the out going solution or by using a different one-sided approximation.

    "So far the only method that we have used that was second order in space **and** time was the leapfrog discretization but that we saw that we had issues with its nondissipative behavior and it is a multi-step method.  Let's explore another approach that is still a one-step method.  Consider the following options:\n",
    "1. Make the method implicit (trapezoidal rule) - We have already mentioned that we should not need to use an implicit method since the advection equation (and many hyperbolic PDEs) are not stiff.\n",
    "2. Use a Runge-Kutta method (RK 2) - This becomes complex near boundaries and may again require extra storage as with leapfro.g\n",
    "3. Use a Taylor series method - This may require multiple evaluations of the spatial discretization but leads to what's called the *Lax-Wendroff method*."
